# Golden Bean Coffee Shop Website



A fully responsive and dynamic e-commerce website for a coffee shop named "Golden Bean." This project features a complete customer-facing interface for browsing and ordering products, along with a secure admin panel for full product management (CRUD). It is built using only HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript, utilizing browser storage to function without a backend database.



## Features

### ðŸ›’ Customer-Facing Site
* **Fully Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Product Page:** All products are loaded from a central data source onto a single, filterable page.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Customers can instantly filter products by category (Hot Coffee, Cold Coffee, Packed Coffee).
* **Persistent Shopping Cart:** The shopping cart state is saved in the browser's local storage, so items are not lost on page reload.
* **No Login Required:** A frictionless experience for customers to browse and add items to their cart.

### ðŸ”’ Admin Panel
* **Secure Admin Login:** The admin dashboard is protected by a dedicated login page.
* **Product Management Dashboard:** A clean and functional interface to view all products at a glance.
* **Full CRUD Functionality:** Admins can easily **C**reate new products, **R**ead (view) existing ones, **U**pdate their details (name, price, etc.), and **D**elete them from the store.
* **Real-time Updates:** Any changes made in the admin panel are immediately reflected on the live customer-facing site.
